# Terraform Module - ACM Certificates

This module creates an ACM certificate and validates it using DNS.

> **Note:** If this module is being used to generate a certificate for a CloudFront distribution, the certificate must be created in the `us-east-1` region. This can be done by passing a correctly configured provider using the `provider` argument to the module.
